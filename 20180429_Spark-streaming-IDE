1. Install Scala IDE locally and build project
	- Start Maven Project
	- When create project, be careful with the naming of groupID and artifactID (they should be the package name later)
	- Configure to add Scala so to compile Scala program
	- Add new object (to a package - JAVA style), name the object as groupID.artifactID.objectname, then the object will be under the package groupID.artifactID

2. Practise with PrintTweets
	- Add correct dependencies, the version names should be correct and corresponds to each other, otherwise there will be import error 
	- check out the dependencies at (https://mvnrepository.com/)
	- (add to pom.xml, which is equivalent to sbt file)
	- Try streaming data from Twitter

3. Practise with StreamingWordCoutn
	- set up netcat: nc -lk 9999
	- connect to localhost 9999
	- setMaster should be "localhost[*]", instead of "localhost", otherwise it complains about no replicates
