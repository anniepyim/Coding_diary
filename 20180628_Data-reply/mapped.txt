Jewish	1
Nazi	1
hunters	1
who	1
find	1
a	1
fictional	1
Adolf	1
Hitler	1
(A.H.)	1
alive	1
in	1
the	1
Amazon	1
jungle	1
thirty	1
years	1
after	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
World	1
War	1
II.	1
The	1
book	1
was	1
controversial,	1
particularly	1
among	1
reviewers	1
and	1
Jewish	1
scholars,	1
because	1
the	1
author	1
allows	1
Hitler	1
to	1
defend	1
himself	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
put	1
on	1
trial	1
in	1
the	1
jungle	1
by	1
his	1
captors.	1
There	1
Hitler	1
maintains	1
that	1
Israel	1
owes	1
its	1
existence	1
to	1
the	1
Holocaust	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
"benefactor	1
of	1
the	1
Jews".[2]	1
The	1
novella	1
was	1
first	1
published	1
in	1
the	1
United	1
Kingdom	1
in	1
May	1
1981	1
as	1
a	1
paperback	1

in	1
April	1

Schuster.	1
Adapted	1
for	1
the	1
theatre	1
by	1
British	1
playwright	1
Christopher	1
Hampton,	1
it	1
was	1
staged	1
in	1
London	1
in	1
1982	1
and	1
in	1
Hartford,	1
Connecticut	1
a	1
year	1
later.	1
The	1
productions	1
generated	1
further	1
controversy,	1
resulting	1
in	1
public	1
pickets	1
and	1
condemnation	1
being	1
levelled	1
against	1
Steiner.	1
A	1
central	1
theme	1
of	1
The	1
Portage	1
is	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
language,	1
and	1
revolves	1
around	1
Steiner's	1
lifelong	1
work	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
and	1
his	1
fascination	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
and	1
terror	1
of	1
human	1
speech.	1
Other	1
themes	1
include	1
the	1
philosophical	1
and	1
moral	1
analysis	1
of	1
history,	1
justice,	1
guilt	1
and	1
revenge.	1
Steiner	1
makes	1
no	1
attempt	1
to	1
explain	1
Hitler,	1
but	1
rather	1
enters	1
into	1
a	1
dialogue	1
with	1
him.	1
Reaction	1
to	1
the	1
book	1
was	1
mixed:	1
in	1
a	1
review	1
in	1
Time	1
magazine,	1
Otto	1
Friedrich	1
described	1
it	1
as	1
"a	1
philosophic	1
fantasy	1
of	1
remarkable	1
intensity",[2]	1
whereas	1
John	1
Leonard	1
of	1
The	1
New	1
York	1
Times	1
called	1
Hitler's	1
speech	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
"obscene",	1
and	1
said	1
Steiner's	1
decision	1
to	1
leave	1
it	1
unchallenged	1
"makes	1
me	1
sick	1
to	1
my	1
stomach."[3]	1
Similarly,	1
many	1
readers	1
and	1
theatre-goers	1
were	1
disturbed	1
by	1
Steiner's	1
fictional	1
Hitler,	1
and	1
the	1
author	1
admitted	1
that	1
his	1
character	1
had	1
gotten	1
the	1
better	1
of	1
him.	1
Despite	1
the	1
controversy,	1
The	1
Portage	1
to	1
San	1
Cristobal	1
of	1
A.H.	1
was	1
a	1
1983	1
finalist	1
in	1
the	1
PEN/Faulkner	1
Award	1
for	1
Fiction.	1
